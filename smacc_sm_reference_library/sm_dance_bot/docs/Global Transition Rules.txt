GLOBAL TRANSITION RULES
---------------------------------

For all states, superstates, If any sensor is lost, transition back to st_acquire_sensors.

For all states, If the Navigation Orthogonal is aborted, transition to st_navigate_to_waypoints_x.


For all states, superstates, but not ssrs, If Keyboard Orthogonal = N, transition to next success state.

For all states, superstates, but not ssrs, If Keyboard Orthogonal = P, transition to previous state.

For all states, If Navigation Orthogonal is prempted, transition to previous state.
